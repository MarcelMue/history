"A while later a demand arose for another special-purpose
program, gres, for substitution:  g/re/s.  Lee McMahon
undertook to write it, and soon foresaw that there would be
no end to the family:  g/re/d, g/re/a, etc.  As his concept
developed it became sed, a tool of remarkable utility that
is largely unappreciated today, because it capitalizes on
the perfect familiarity with ed that was universal ten years
ago, but no more.  Sed covers a lot of needs.  For example,
we have never seen fit to adopt the widespread `head'
utility because `sed 10q' does just as well."(44)

The third project was Bob Morris and Lee McMahon’s work
on the authorship of the Federalist papers. Working with the
ideas of statistician Fredrick Mosteller, Morris and McMahon were
trying to determine who wrote which paper using statistical
analysis. "Taking turns typing," they entered the
papers into the machine to run them through various filters and
counters. They "developed lots of tools for processing text
in the process." Typo, for example, was "one of the
early spell-checkers." It worked based on trigram
statistics, a Mosteller technique that analyzed chunks of
repeated letters. Cherry’s familiarity with trigram
statistics had come from a compression project she worked on in
1976. She describes the process:

You take the whole string, if your ten-letter work had maybe a
trigram that was six letters long that had a high enough count
to be worthwhile, you pick that entire six-letter string off
and store it in a dictionary and replace it with a byte and then
with an index into the dictionary.

This counting procedure was applied to the other forms of
analysis, for example, the Federalist papers authorship research.

At ManorCare in New Providence, my father-in-law Arne
Swenson sits with Gertrude and Helen for meals. I
eventually found that Helen's last name is McMahon,
 and being a Bear's fan, I mentioned Jim McMahon of
Chicago Bears and Superbowl Shuffle fame. Helen told
me that her husband's name was Lee, and I told her
that I had a coworker at Bell Labs named Lee McMahon.
I found a photo via Google images, and she said "That's him!"

I worked with Lee McMahon and Bill Marshall on Datakit,
a computer network invented by Sandy Fraser in Computer
Science Research at Bell Labs Murray Hill. In my mind,
I can still picture Lee and Bill in the "Wurlitzer" room
which was adjacent to the Unix room in building 2, fifth
floor. It was called the Wurlitzer room because the layers
of consoles for the Datakit switches resembled a massive
organ. Lee and Bill stood at the center of it all.

I can still picture Lee standing in my office doorway to
chat about work. He was a chain smoker and would tap ashes
into the door latch hole. When I poked him about it he
said that there was no problem since the door jamb and
walls were all steel. I still wondered at the surprise
of a column of ashes for workers doing any remodeling. Lee
got throat cancer and a laryngectomy. He returned to work
after treatment, and I remember the shock and sympathetic
pain that I felt for him as he struggled to speak. We
resorted to communicating via pen and paper. Looking back,
I can see the interest and effort that he took to encourage
me professionally and personally - what a great guy!

Lee E. McMahon’s linguistic insight fostered the characteristic
text-processing—as distinct from-text-formatting—capabilities of
the system. He wrote comm, qsort, sed, the current grep, and the
concordance-builders index for English and cref for C. After an
early fling with cu and an influential laboratory switching system
done with Condon, Morris, Thompson, Chuck (Charles  B.)Haleyand Cherry,
Lee became the prime software architect for Sandy Fraser’s Datakit® switch.

In the 1960s, Takao Matsuda and his wife operated a Go studio where
there were usually about a dozen players, but it was not financially
successful and eventually closed. In the late 1950s and early 1960s
go players were invited to play at the Nippon Club on East 96th Street
and on 57th Street where the Nippon Club is now located. Many players
regularly played there. It was their club manager, Horiguchi-san that
made this possible. Other players used to come together in Washington
Square Park and during the winter they met in various coffee shops in
the Village or at "Go parties" in peoples' homes.

In the late 1960s The New York Go Club was reestablished meeting in a
hotel across from Lincoln Center. This was also arranged for and
managed by Horiguchi San.  It remained there until about 1971 when
it moved to a room in the Chess House on 72nd Street. This was arranged
for by Paul Anderson, a past President of the American Go Association,
who also helped arrange for The New York Go Club to return to the
Marshall Chess Club one or two years later.

In the early 1980's, the club was upstairs of a Korean restaurant
on W 32nd St. Then President Marvin Wolfthal moved the club to
a coffee shop on 26th St and 2nd Ave. Michael Simon took over
and moved it to 5th Ave and 23rd St in 1988, and then in 1991 to
49th St between Lexington and 3rd Avenues.

The last New York Go Club closed in 1995. Most of its members
joined The New York Go Center at that time.
